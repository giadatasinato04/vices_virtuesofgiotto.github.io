# Vices and Virtues of Giotto 

This project was created by [Giada Tasinato](https://github.com/giadatasinato04?tab=repositories), [Rachele Alba](https://github.com/rachelealba96?tab=repositories) and [Samantha Broking](https://github.com/samanthabroking?tab=repositories) to showcase the skills acquired within the course, Modeling and Visualizing Textual Data. This master's class was held at Ca' Foscari and taught by professor Tiziana Mancinelli and professor Antonio Montefusco.

## About the Project
From the recommended theme of Vices and Virtues, we decided to focus our project on those depicted by Giotto which can be seen in the Cappella degli Scrovegni (PD). We started by building a concept map to help us visualize the structure we wanted for our project. After carefully considering multiple ontologies, we chose Wikidata becsause it best represented our ideas.

While we had many possibilities, we chose Giotto because of the close proximity of the chapel. We had the opportunity to visit the site along with taking photos to use for our project. With the help of our lab instructor, [Valerio Remediani](https://github.com/VRemediani), we attained the iiif links of the 14 images so we could implement them into OpenSeadragon and Mirador.
